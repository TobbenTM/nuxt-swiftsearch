## What happened with Vue Instantsearch, and why another module?

Instantsearch provides a set of _very convenient_ tools for building your search UI with algolia in a fast way and with great DX.
So why building a nuxt module?
Well, vue-instantsearch approach for managing state does not play well with the SSR approach, basically this is what happens:

- Components are inserted inside a slot (the `AisInstantSearchComponent`)
- At the `setup` (or `created`) step in the Vue lifecycle they subscribe themselves to the Instantsearch instance
- The instantsearch instance, when all components have been subscribed, makes a request
- Components gets hydrated

This provides the best DX for the end user, but _there's a catch_: in SSR the components can't be hydrated because everything gets done in a single tick.

This package re-implements Vue Instantsearch components so that they read and write to a `centralized` instance, that gets injected with widgets beforehand so that Nuxt can handle everything in the same tick.
